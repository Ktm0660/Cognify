# Website Revamp Roadmap

This roadmap outlines a staged approach to modernizing and expanding the GTW web app without destabilizing production features. Each phase assumes a short feedback loop with stakeholders before moving on.

## Phase 0 – Discovery & Alignment
- Audit the existing routes (`Home`, `Game`, `IceCream` flows, `BootyGame`, `BankGame`) and catalog their current behaviors.
- Inventory shared UI building blocks in `src/components` and `src/styles` to understand what can be reused or refactored.
- Capture design requirements: visual style, accessibility goals, target devices, and any analytics or telemetry needs.
- Define success metrics for the revamp (e.g., user engagement, reduced support requests, performance budgets).

## Phase 1 – Design System Foundation
- Establish a token-based theme (colors, typography, spacing) and surface it through a central style module or CSS-in-JS solution.
- Replace ad-hoc CSS with composable components (buttons, inputs, layout primitives) that encapsulate the new branding.
- Introduce Storybook or a similar playground so components can be reviewed in isolation.

## Phase 2 – Information Architecture & Navigation
- Revisit the authenticated flow in `App.js` to simplify routing logic and ensure consistent guards for login/info prerequisites.
- Add a persistent navigation experience (e.g., sidebar or tab bar) that highlights available games and user actions.
- Provide clear breadcrumbs or progress indicators for multi-step experiences like the Ice Cream and Bank games.

## Phase 3 – Page-Level Refreshes
- Prioritize high-traffic pages (Home dashboard, Game launcher) for redesign, focusing on onboarding clarity and calls to action.
- Redesign individual game setup and results pages with the new components, ensuring responsive layouts and improved copy.
- Introduce contextual help/tooltips explaining strategies, scoring, and expected user inputs.

## Phase 4 – Performance & Data Enhancements
- Evaluate data fetching patterns in Firebase integrations; adopt suspense-friendly hooks or caching where appropriate.
- Implement loading states, optimistic UI, and error boundaries to cover slow networks or Firestore failures gracefully.
- Add analytics events around key interactions to measure the impact of visual and UX changes.

## Phase 5 – Polish & Launch Readiness
- Conduct accessibility and cross-browser testing; remediate issues uncovered by automated tooling and manual QA.
- Prepare migration guides or release notes for internal stakeholders describing the changes and rollout plan.
- Schedule incremental rollouts (feature flags, percentage-based deploys) so feedback can be collected safely.

## Working Agreement
- Progress one phase at a time. Do not begin the next phase until the current phase is reviewed and signed off.
- Maintain automated test coverage throughout; add regression tests as new components and flows are introduced.
- Keep change logs up to date so each commit corresponds to a clear step in the roadmap.
